  Declarative enhancement for HTML: simple, composable, lean. TwinSpark
  transfers lots of the common logic from JS into a few declarative HTML
  attributes. This leads to a good interactive sites with little JS and more manageable
  code.

## What it is

TwinSpark could be mentally split in three parts:

- [Page fragment updates](api/ts-req/) facilitated via HTML attributes
  (no JS needed). This is the core idea.
- [Morphing](api/ts-swap/#morph) - a strategy to update HTML gradually,
  without breaking state and focus. Makes form validation and animations on HTML
  changes a breeze.
- [Actions](api/ts-action/) - incredibly simple promise-enabled language for
  (limited) client-side scripting. Bring your logic into a single place.

Some reasons why TwinSpark exists despite [HTMx](https://htmx.org/) and
[Unpoly](https://unpoly.com/) (those are similar in approach):

- It's really small ([8KB `.min.gz`](https://github.com/piranha/twinspark-js/blob/master/dist/twinspark.min.js)).
- There is no attribute inheritance â€” keeps surprises away.
- [Batching](api/ts-req-batch/) - very useful if you want to use HTTP
  caching effectively, while maintaining some personalisation for your
  users.
- Bundled - a lot of practical stuff packed in, like actions, or non-traditional
  [event triggers](api/ts-trigger), or morphing.
- Extensibility - you can easily register new directives the same way those in
  core are registered.
